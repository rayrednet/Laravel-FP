## üåç Project Overview
For our final project in the Laravel framework course, we plan to develop a website called **ArtisanEats**, a Food Order Delivery Website. This website will allow customers to browse food menus and place delivery orders. The website will feature a clean and visually appealing green theme to represent freshness and sustainability.

### üìä Planned Models:

1. **Cart Model**:  
   This model will handle the shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add, update, and remove items from their cart. It will manage the relationship between users and the products they wish to purchase.

2. **Product Model**:  
   The Product model will represent individual food items available for order. It will include attributes such as name, description, price, and image URL. This model will be essential for displaying menu items to users.

3. **User Model**:  
   This model will manage user information for both customers and admins. It will handle user authentication, registration, and role-based access control, ensuring that users can log in and access features relevant to their role.

4. **Order Model**:  
   The Order model will track customer orders, including the items ordered, quantities, user details, and order status (e.g., pending, completed). This model will be critical for managing the ordering process and ensuring that orders are processed correctly.

## üîÑ Planned vs Actual Models Comparison:

| **Planned Model**    | **Actual Model**     | **Differences/Changes**  | **Reason for Change**                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**             | **User**             | Same                     | This model is crucial for managing customer data and authentication. |
| **Product**          | **Menu**             | Name changed from "Product" to "Menu" | To better align with the food delivery context, the term "Menu" was used to reflect the items available for order. |
| **Cart**             | **Cart**             | Same                     | Required for the shopping functionality, no changes.       |
| **Order**            | **Transaction**      | Name changed to "Transaction" | The model was renamed to "Transaction" to clarify its function, reflecting the overall process from order placement to payment. |
| **Chef**             | **Chef**             | New Model Added           | Initially not planned, but added to provide users with detailed chef profiles, enhancing the user experience. |
| **Category**         | **Category**         | New Model Added           | Added to organize the menu items into specific food categories for better browsing functionality. |
| **TransactionItem**  | **TransactionItem**  | New Model Added           | Tracks individual items within each transaction to record the details of each menu item ordered. |
| **CartItem**         | **CartItem**         | New Model Added           | Holds the items added to the cart before checkout. This was added to simplify managing multiple items in the user's cart. |

### üí° Explanation of Changes:
1. **Menu vs Product**:  
   The name was changed from "Product" to "Menu" to better reflect the context of the application. Since the website deals with food items, "Menu" is a more intuitive term for users.

2. **Transaction vs Order**:  
   We replaced "Order" with "Transaction" to align with common e-commerce terminology and Laravel's standard practices. This also emphasizes the entire lifecycle of a transaction, from order placement to payment.

3. **New Models (Chef, Category, CartItem, TransactionItem)**:  
   These models were added as the project evolved to meet the application's needs. **Chef** and **Category** were added to provide more detailed functionality for browsing food items and highlighting the experts behind the dishes. **CartItem** and **TransactionItem** were added to efficiently manage multiple items in the cart and orders.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features (Planned vs Actual)

### Key Features (Planned):
1. **Menu Display**:  
   Customers will be able to view a list of available food items, including details such as price, description, and images.

2. **Order System**:  
   Customers can add food items to their cart, adjust quantities, and place orders for delivery.

3. **User Authentication**:  
   Separate login systems for customers and admins. Admins will manage the menu, view orders, and update order statuses.

4. **Responsive Design**:  
   The website will be designed to work seamlessly on both mobile devices and desktops.

---

### Key Features (Actual):

1. **Menu Display**:  
   The menu display remains the same as planned. Customers can browse a list of available food items, view prices, descriptions, and images. Categories and chefs are also integrated into the menu display to enhance navigation.

2. **Order through Cart**:  
   Users can add food items to their cart, adjust quantities, and place orders for delivery. Instead of a direct order system, the **Cart** model was implemented to manage items before finalizing orders. 

3. **User Authentication (Customer Only)**:  
   User authentication is implemented, but **only for customers**. The admin system for managing the menu, orders, and statuses has not been implemented in this version, focusing more on the customer-facing features.

4. **Responsive Design**:  
   The website is designed to work seamlessly on both mobile devices and desktops, as planned, providing a smooth user experience across platforms.

5. **Chef Page** (New Addition):  
   A dedicated **Chef Page** was added where users can view the details of chefs who prepared the dishes. This feature wasn't part of the initial plan but was added to enhance user interaction and provide more information about the experts behind the food.
